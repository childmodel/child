# Mesh setup parameters
#
# These parameters control the initial configuration of the mesh. Here you
# specify whether a new or existing mesh is to be used; the geometry and
# resolution of a new mesh (if applicable); the boundary settings; etc.
#
#  Notes:
#
#    OPTREADINPUT - controls the source of the initial mesh setup:
#                    0 = create a new mesh in a rectangular domain
#                    1 = read in an existing triangulation (eg, earlier run)
#                    2 = create a new mesh by triangulating a given set
#                        of (x,y,z) points
#    INPUTDATAFILE - use this only if you want to read in an existing
#                    triangulation, either from an earlier run or from
#                    a dataset.
#    INPUTTIME - if reading in a mesh from an earlier run, this specifies
#                    the time slice number

#   Erosion and sediment transport parameters
#   (note: choice of sediment-transport law is dictated at compile-time;
#    see tErosion.h)
#
#   Important notes on parameters:
#
#   (1) kb, kt, mb, nb and pb are defined as follows:
#         E = kb * ( tau - taucrit ) ^ pb,
#         tau = kt * q ^ mb * S ^ nb,
#         q = Q / W,  W = Wb ( Q / Qb ) ^ ws,  Wb = kw Qb ^ wb
#      where W is width, Q total discharge, Qb bankfull discharge,
#      Wb bankfull width. Note that kb, mb and nb are NOT the same as the
#      "familiar" K, m, and n as sometimes used in the literature.
#
#   (2) For power-law sediment transport, parameters are defined as follows:
#         capacity (m3/yr) = kf * W * ( tau - taucrit ) ^ pf
#         tau = kt * q ^ mf * S ^ nf
#         q is as defined above
#
#   (3) KT and TAUC are given in SI units -- that is, time units of seconds
#       rather than years. The unit conversion to erosion rate or capacity
#       is made within the code.
#

#     2 = Parker width closure: tau / tauc = const

Comments here:

This is a sample input file for the Child and Toddler models. The parameters
are ballpark numbers and should not necessarily be considered to have any 
particular empirical / observational basis (though a few do). When run, this 
input file models a rising mountain block of 10km by 10km between two fixed 
boundaries. One hundred thousand years of simulation time create an uplifted 
plateau (100m high) that is incised along its edges.
