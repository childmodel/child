    <h2>Smudge: Troubleshooting</h2>
<UL>
<LI>
Smudge has only been compiled and tested on a LINUX box running Redhat7.0. However, it is known that there can
 be problems using Qt-2.2.0 (the code produces a segmentation fault when run). Successful runs have only
been obtained so far after compiling and linking with Qt-2.3.0. 
<LI>
The most likely secondary cause of a "segmentation fault" on running chintz is the definition of a switch
in the smudge.ui file before the name to which it refers has been defined.
<LI>
A complaint on compilation that a variable is not defined is likely to be where a switch is set for 
a name which has not been defined at all
<LI>
If tags are increctly speled or capitalized, or contain spaces, or are given an id=name where none is expected, they may be ignored (just as in HTML). This may lead to some
 weird effects, especially if a termination tag is missing. Smudge tries to 
check for tag errors and hopefully will produce a reasonable error message.
<LI>
Setting the correct geometry is very important :- if two elements are given the same geometry, one will be
hidden behind the other, and will be invisible in chintz. Similarly, if elements are put into a frame which
is too small, they may not appear in the UI.
<LI>
Buttons and CheckBoxes must be defined in the .ChintzDefaults file if their values are to be saved
correctly when they have not been modfied during the current session.
<LI>
You can safely ignore errors of the form<br>
rm: cannot remove `chintz.o': No such file or directory <br>
make: *** [clean] Error 1 <br>
when running smudge
