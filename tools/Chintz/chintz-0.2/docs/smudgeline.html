    <h2>Smudge: The Line Tag</h2>
A Line provides the second of four ways of setting variables for the child control file. Again,
the id is used to provide the name of the child variable to be written out, but a text box is used
to set its value. The Line provides a text box with a <a href="smudgetitle.html">Title</a>, each of which
has a separate <a href="smudgegeometry.html">Geometry</a>, so that their sizes can be set separately. The &lt Title> &lt /Title> tag can <em> in this case only </em> 
have a &lt Geometry> embedded within it to set its size. 
&lt Geometry> set outside of the Title, but
within the &lt Line> &lt /Line> delimiters sets the size of the text box. The title and text box can also each
separately be set to boldface. Again, a Line must be set into a separate <a href="smudgeframe.html">Frame</a>
 if it is to be switched on 
or off.<br>
A further special tag is available <em>only</em> for the Line tag, namely 
<a href="smudgebrowse.html">&lt BrowseButton></a>. This tag must appear at the end of the specification,
just before &lt /Line>. There is <em>no</em> closing &lt /BrowseButton>. This draws a small clickable button
to the right of the textbox, which when clicked brings up a file browser. The text box value and the variable
 named in the Line id are set to the value of the file selected. <br> 

<br>

Hence:-<br><br>
<font color="#ff00aa">
&lt Page><br>
 &lt Title> Setup &lt /Title><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &lt Frame,id=Firstframe><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Style> NoFrame &lt /Style><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Geometry> 10 10 100 200 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Enabled> false &lt /Enabled><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Title> Mesh &lt /Title><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Line,id=NUM_PTS><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt Geometry> 80 10 110 20 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt Title> Number of Random \nGrid Points <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Geometry> 10 10 70 20 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt /Title><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt BrowseButton><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt /Line><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &lt /Frame><br>
&lt /Page><br>
</font><br>
a page, labelled "Setup", containing a frame labelled "Mesh", which in turn contains a Line 
labelled "Number of Random Grid Points". 
This title will be Drawn to the left of the text box (starting 10 pixels into the Frame).
The value typed into the text box will be assigned to the variable NUM_PTS, for writing to the control file,
as in the <a href="smudgebutt.html">Buttons</a> example.
Again if the id is omitted, then an internally
generated variable name will be written to the control file.
