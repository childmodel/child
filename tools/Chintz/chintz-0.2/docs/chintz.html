    <h2>Using Chintz</h2>
Chintz provides a means for constructing the driver files for the child program. At present this is
only available for the LINUX platform, and it has only been tested under RedHat7.0.
It does not run
child itself :- once the driver file is constructed, child must be run separately. Existing driver files can
be loaded for modification, provided that the variable names are recognised by the interface. Unrecognised
variables will be loaded into the "Miscellaneous" page, provided that there are no more than 16 of them.
This page also allows the definition of new variables which are not catered for elsewhere. For an explanation
of the driver file variables, see the <a href="childuguide.html">Child User Guide</a>. <br>
Entry of text into the various text boxes does not generally require return to be pressed - the variables to 
which each box is bound will be updated as you type. The one exception to this is the text box
labelled "Child Control File" on the button bar. Changes in this box only take effect when you press return
so as to avoid confusion and overwriting of exiting driver files.<br>
Default values for the child variables are read in at start up from the file .ChintzDefaults. It is not
recommended that you edit this file by hand. If you wish to modify it, then alter the values in the user
interface, and use Save As... to make a new default file
<br>
The appearance and behaviour of the user interface can be modified fairly extensively by using the code
generator provided :- <a href="smudge.html">Smudge</a>
