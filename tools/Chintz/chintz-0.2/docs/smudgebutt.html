    <h2>Smudge: The Buttons Tag</h2>
Buttons provide a special container within which the user can place clickable 
<a href="smudgeradio.html">RadioButtons</a>. The RadioButtons
are exclusive, that is only one of them can be selected at any time. As with the previous containers, the
Buttons container can have a <a href="smudgetitle.html">Title</a>, which may be <a href="smudgebold.html">Bold</a>, and a <a href="smudgegeometry.html">Geometry</a>. However, the Buttons container cannot 
be switched :- to do this, it must be embedded within another switchable element, such as a Frame. This is to
allow a secondary use for the id, which is to identify a variable whose value is to be written to the child
control file.<br>

Example:-<br><br>
<font color="#ff00aa">
&lt Page><br>
 &lt Title> Setup &lt /Title><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &lt Frame,id=Firstframe><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Style> NoFrame &lt /Style><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Geometry> 10 10 100 200 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Enabled> false &lt /Enabled><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &lt Title> Mesh &lt /Title><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Buttons,id=OPT_PT_PLACE><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt Geometry> 10 10 70 100 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt Title> Open Boundary Type &lt /Title><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt RadioButton> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Geometry> 10 10 70 20 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Title> Corner &lt /Title><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt /RadioButton> <br><br> 
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt RadioButton> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Geometry> 10 30 70 20 &lt /Geometry><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt Title> 1 Side &lt /Title><br>
&nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &lt /RadioButton> <br><br> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt /Buttons><br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &lt /Frame><br>
&lt /Page><br>
</font><br>
a page, labelled "Setup", containing a frame labelled "Mesh", which in turn contains a Buttons container 
labelled "Open Boundary Type". This title will be inset into the Buttons border, as for the Box container.
The Buttons geometry is again relative to the Frame which contains it, so its origin is 10 pixels into the 
frame. There are two RadioButtons in the box, with labels "Corner" and "1 Side". The RadioButton
Geometry sets their positions in the Box. In this case the RadioButtons are aligned in X, but are placed one
above another using the Yorigin. When the "Corner" 
RadioButton is selected, the value 0 will be assigned to the variable OPT_PT_PLACE,
as defined by the id of the Buttons container. When the control file is saved, the text<br><br>
OPT_PT_PLACE:<br>
0<br><br>
will be written to it. Similarly, selecting the second button will give OPT_PT_PLACE value 1. In this way
the options for child can be set up as required. Note that if the id is omitted, then an internally
generated variable name (e.g. Buttons1var) will be written to the control file.
