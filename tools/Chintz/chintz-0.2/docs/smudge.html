    <h2>Smudge</h2>
The purpose of smudge is to provide a simple but limited means for the modification of
chintz without the need for writing any C++ code. This is done by providing the user
with a script which reads a specification file and re-compiles the user interface
so as to incorporate the changes made, automatically updating the portions of chintz which write 
the child model's driver files (see the <A href="childuguide.html">child user guide</A>). The
specification file is named smudge.ui, and is written in a markup format similar to HTML, 
with a limited number of tags that specify the appearance of the tabs in chintz. 
Tags are of the form <br><br>
<font color="#ff00aa">
&lt Identifier,id=name> <em>text</em> &lt /Identifier>  <br><br>
</font>
where "text" may include further tags. Note that as with HTML there should be no spaces
between the angle brackets. The  ",id=name" part of the tag is optional, and is used either to identify
the child variable names, or else to set the behaviour of switches. <br><br>
