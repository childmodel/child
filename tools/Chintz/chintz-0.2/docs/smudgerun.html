    <h2>Running Smudge</h2>
Smudge is a command line program. There are no arguments to it. It runs from a single shell script named
smudge which calls the program smudge_exec to generate C++ code.
The definitions for the user interface must be saved in a single file called smudge.ui :- a version is 
provided with the distribution. There is also a copy called smudge.defaults_ui for recovery in case of 
disaster. Edit the smudge.ui, save your changes and then type smudge at the command line. 
The code will be re-compiled, and you should see your changes when you next run chintz. If you make 
extensive changes then you should make a new .ChintzDefaults file. This is particularly the case if you
add any Buttons containers or CheckBoxes. By default, any variable whose value is not set in the user 
interface does not get written to the child control file. If .ChintzDefaults does not contain entries for
the RadioButtons or CheckBoxes, then their values will not be written to the control file unless they have
been modified (even though they appear to have values in the user interface). For this reason you should
run chintz and modify the contents of each new CheckBox or Buttons group, and then save these to the 
.ChintzDefaults file when first running chintz after modification.
