    <h2>Smudge: Operation and Filenames</h2>

Smudge uses the Qt widget set which is free for UNIX platforms from <a href="www.trolltech.com">www.trolltech.com</a> and which is distributed with many LINUX versions. The code is written entirely in C++.
When smudge is run it first compiles smudge_exec.cpp (if necessary :- using "make smudge") and runs it. 
Smudge_exec reads the smudge.ui file and a list of names of the
widgets to be generated in the user interface is printed.
At the same time generates a set of files containing C++ code these are:-
<OL>
<LI>generated_blankcode        
<LI>generated_child_outputcode
<LI>generated_chintz_base_constructor_insert
<LI>generated_slotcode 
<LI>generated_chintz_base_header_insert
<LI>generated_slot_header_insert
<LI>generated_child_readcode 
<LI>generated_extra_readcode
</OL>
The  first four of these are incoporated into chintz_base.cpp. Items 5 and 6 are used to construct
a new header file chintz_base.h using chintz_header.bottom and chintz_header.top. For this reason it is
best not to modify chintz_base.h by hand unless you also remember to make the same changes in 
chintz_header.top before running smudge.<br>
The last two items are incorporated into ReadChildContolFile.cpp, which is then also added to 
chintz_base.cpp. <br>
Finally, "make chintz" is used to compile the new code.
