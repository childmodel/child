CHILD: The Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development
=============================================================

The Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD)
model is a computer program that simulates the evolution of a
landscape. CHILD was cre- ated beginning in 1996 and 1997 by Greg Tucker,
Stephen Lancaster and Nicole Gasparini, working in Rafael Brasâ€™
research group in the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Further development, including creation of many new modules
and capabilities, has contin- ued since that time.

For basic information about CHILD and its capabilities, see
Tucker et al. (2001a) as well as the references listed in the
bibliography at the end of this guide.
